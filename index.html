<h1>First Web Page</h1>
<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>I might be new to web development, but I've learned alot so far.</p>
<h3>GitHub</h3>
<p>I've learned to manage code in repositories on GitHub. This allows me to be able to work on my projects anywhere. No more worries about losing a portable drive!</p>
<h3>Basic HTML</h3>
<p>I've also learned to write some of the most common HTML tags, and to write HTML for structure not appearance. <br> Some of the tags that I've learned include headings &#40;&#60;h1&#62;,&#60;h2&#62;,&#60;h3&#62;,ect.&#41;, paragraphs, and lists. I've also learned to use special entity characters.</p>

    <ol>
    <li>I get to learn how to make my own web pages.</li>
    <li>I have a pretty chill teacher that I really like.</li>
    <li>I got to learn how to use GitHub!</li>
    </ol>
    
<h3>Goals</h3>
I'm excited to learn more so that I can:
    <ul>
    <li>Use my creativity to make whatever kind of web pages I want to.</li>
    <li>Help my current employer build their web page.</li>
    <li>Find jobs in the future building web pages in HTML.</li>
    </ul>
